# hello-world
My first repository

Hi everyone who maybe will read this someday!

I'm Pedro Mello, and this is my first GitHub branch. I'm reading good stuff about how to use this platform that, I believe,
will be of great use in the future. I like to make good art, be it drawing, writing stories or coding. And I want to join all of this together with great fun games!
